# Discrete Mathematics

This repository contains Python scripts that I create while exploring different topics in **Discrete Mathematics**. Each script solves a specific problem or concept inspired by the book *Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction* by **Oscar Levin**.

ðŸ“Œ **Note:** This repository is currently on hold and is not actively maintained.  

## Topics Covered

1. **Sequences**
    - `seq.py`: Check if a sequence is arithmetic or geometric and print the formula
    - `seq_sum.py`: Calculate the sum of an arithmetic sequence
    - `continued_frac.py`: Convert a repeating decimal number into a fraction
    - `seq_sum_geo.py`: Calculate the sum of a geometric sequence
    - `diffs.py`: Find the difference between each consecutive pair of numbers in a sequence. And find the coefficients of the polynomial that generates the sequence.
    - `find_n_term.ipynb`: Find the coefficients of the polynomial that generates given sequence.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. If you don't have Python, you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Some extra Python modules maybe needed for certain scripts.

### How to use

These scripts are designed for my personal learning journey in discrete mathematics. Feel free to modify or extend the scripts as you explore additional topics or problems.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Run any script from the respective chapter folder. For example, to run the seq.py script: `python3 sequences/seq.py`
